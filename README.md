# Gnucap overview

Gnucap is an open-source circuit simulator, or circuit analysis package \(in short: CAP\).

Nice overviews on Gnucap can be found in FOSDEM talks:

* [Gnucap, and analog and mixed signal simulation](https://archive.fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/cad_gnucap/)
* [gnucap - recent work and directions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyeMORbswKk)

The main Gnucap project page can be found [at the GNU servers](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnucap/gnucap.html). Note,this page is a bit older and does tno reflect all the recent development that can be found on in the Gnucap source code.

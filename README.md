# Gnucap overview

The aim of this book is to help people to get started with Gnucap. Gnucap is an open-source circuit simulator, or circuit analysis package \(in short: CAP\). This book can also be read on gitbooks: https://mulder-patrick.gitbook.io/gnucap/

Nice overviews on Gnucap can be found in FOSDEM talks:

* [Gnucap, and analog and mixed signal simulation](https://archive.fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/cad_gnucap/)
* [gnucap - recent work and directions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyeMORbswKk)
* the gnucap wiki: http://www.gnucap.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=gnucap:start

The main Gnucap project page can be found [at the GNU servers](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnucap/gnucap.html). Note,this page is a bit older and does tno reflect all the recent development that can be found on in the Gnucap source code.

A useful resource for help is the Gnucap manual: [https://www.gnu.org/software/gnucap/gnucap-man.pdf](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnucap/gnucap-man.pdf)

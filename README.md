# Getting started with GNUCAP


## Building Gnucap from source

You can download gnucap from the Gnu savannah repos:

    origin    git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gnucap.git 


After running the default build commands:

    ./configure
    ./make

It might be necessary to reload the shared libraries with:

     ldconfig
     ./configure
